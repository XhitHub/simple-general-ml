      model test score
      class gd count
      avg err of trusted class gd cells
        trusted class gd cells
          class gd cells with proba >= min trust threshold
        as in PROD, will ivst according to trusted class gd cells. this estimates how doing ivst according to trusted class gd cells will goes
  impl
    in test split part:
      for each predY col
        1. count class gd
        2. pick class gd cells
          compare with df_valid
          calc avg err of them
